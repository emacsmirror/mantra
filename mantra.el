;; Mantras, not macros! A system for defining, parsing, and acting on
;; user activity.
;;
;; This package provides two main facilities:
;;
;; 1. A DSL for composing "mantras" to represent complex user
;;    actions.  Mantras are a more expressive form of keyboard macro,
;;    able to include conditions, loops, and programmatic logic.  This
;;    can be used to script user behavior, similar to how Selenium is
;;    used to automate web browsers.
;;
;; 2. A real-time parser that can match live user activity against
;;    arbitrary patterns and conditions.  This allows you to define
;;    patterns of "interesting" activity and trigger custom actions
;;    (including, commonly, mantras) when those patterns are detected.
;;
;; Together, these components enable the creation of powerful tools
;; like intelligent repeat mechanisms (e.g., repeating actions that
;; involve completion UIs), creating contextual location histories
;; like the jump and change lists in Evil mode, or advanced command
;; recorders.
